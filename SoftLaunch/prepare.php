	<p>You must wear your chip timing piece during the entire event! You will be given a band that will hold it around your ankle throughout the entire event. Be sure that it is snapped tightly, that it is on before you start the race, and make sure you step over the timing mats after each segment of the race. If you are wearing a wet-suit, be sure the timing piece goes under your wetsuit, otherwise, you will have a very difficult time getting it off!</p>

        <h5>What To Bring</h5>
<div class="section2 group2">
	<div class="col span_1_of_3">
	<h5>Swim</h5>  Wetsuits are optional for the swim section though they will provide buoyancy and warmth. Many people opt of wearing their wetsuit for the triathlon so if you don't have one you'll be fine.  We will provide you with a swim cap but you will want to bring your own goggles.
	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_3">
	<h5>Bike</h5>  A biking helmet is mandatory. You will also receive 2 stickers in your package with your race number on them. The small sticker goes on the front of your helmet and the bigger sticker will wrap around your bike frame. Road or mountain bikes are acceptable. For safety reasons, be sure to have end-caps on the end of your handle-bars.
	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_3">
<h5>Run</h5>  You must finish the race with your bib number on the front of you. Some people choose to pin it on at the beginning of the race and have it on for the whole event so they don√≠t have to worry about it, others pin it on a singlet that they put on once they finish the swim and before they head out for the bike. Others use an elastic racing strap that they pin their bib number to and then quickly strap it on before they leave for the run. Use whatever option feels best for you.
